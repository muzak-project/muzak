  Welcome to muzak's interactive setup.
  This script is useful primarily for first-time users.
  This WILL rewrite your configuration, so be careful about using it.

  Congratulations! You should be (nearly) ready to use muzak.
  The only thing remaining is to run the indexer:
    muzak-index [--deep]
  See the muzak-index's --help flag for more information on options.
  Once the indexer finishes, just start the daemon:
    muzakd
  Once running, you'll be able to muzak through muzak-cmd and muzak-dmenu!
